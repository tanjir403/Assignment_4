## What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

- getElementById selects one element using its unique ID.

- getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements with the same class. 

- while querySelector / querySelectorAll use CSS selectors to select one or multiple elements.

## How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

- You can create a new element using document.createElement() and then insert it into the DOM using methods like appendChild() or append() on a parent element.

## What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?

- Event Bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and then moves up to its parent elements in the DOM.

##  What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

- Event Delegation is a technique where you add one event listener to a parent element instead of adding listeners to multiple child elements.

##  What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

- preventDefault() stops the default browser action (like preventing a form from submitting or a link from opening).

- stopPropagation() stops the event from moving up or down the DOM (it prevents event bubbling or capturing).
